# pathfinding-maze-game
A JavaFX maze game that generates a maze and spawns an enemy to chase your character

This is a game that generates a maze using a depth-first search algorithm. The objective of the player is to traverse the maze to collect all the coins while trying to avoid the enemy. The enemy is continously chasing the player and its path is generated using a breadth-first search algorithm that is continously updated.
